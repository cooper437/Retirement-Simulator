# Retirement Simulator

Generate personalized retirement planning advice based on a variety of input variables including asset mix, lifestyle decisions, wealth goals, market conditions, and inflation regime. A monte-carlo simulator runs through thousands of possible outcomes and their statistical probability to give the user the following information:

- Detailed metrics on portfolio survival rate, safe contribution amount pre-retirement, and safe withdrawal amount post retirement.
- Summary statistics on portfolio outcomes at 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles including rates of return, wealth transfer amount, withdrawal and contribution amounts
- Portfolio balances over time at various percentile outcomes.

In addition to the basic input form, a turbo-tax style workflow is provided that allows entry of assets through a multi-step wizard with questions about current lifestyle, lifestyle goals, current portfolio, income, and retirement expectations.
